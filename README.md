# SODA_Anomaly_Detection
### Anomaly detection in particles collision with machine learning techniques.

This repository comprises two versions of our model:

- The notebook version: Jupiter notebook visual interface makes it easier to comprehend and learn about our model. Additionally, you can see how the code works without the need to run it. However, the notebook is a bit slow.

- The Script version: if you are already used to programming, this version provides a more efficient and fast version of our model. 

#### The .csv file for background and signal events are available here: 
 
 - Background sample (QCD dijets): https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/9fyDYxRSAIFrvx7 

 - Signal sample (dijet r√©sonance): https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/u1QFKMrHeIepie5

 - Those files should be placed inside "/Input/" folder for the model properly locate them.
